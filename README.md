# Tic Tac Toe Game in C++

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++.

## Features

- Two players take turns to make moves on a 3x3 board.
- The program checks for a winner or a draw after each move.
- The console displays the current state of the board and announces the winner or a draw.

## How to Play

1. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (both starting from 0).
2. The game continues until there is a winner or a draw.
